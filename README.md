# Eat Da Burger
## Description 
This application can be utilized to make a delicious list of burgers that you're looking to devour!

## Live Site 
[Eat Da Burger App!](https://obscure-hamlet-35486.herokuapp.com/)

## Usage 
When starting the application you'll be able to enter a burger that you want to eat in the text field. Hitting the Add Dat Burger Button, you add it to your list of burgers that you want to eat. When you finally decide to eat it then you're able to press the devour button and move it over to your devoured list! If you want it again you just need to re-order it.

## Challenges 
Unfortunately I was only able to get the base adding piece of the application working, however I am very close to the update portion of it. It is still fully deployed, which took a long time to do as well. I plan on coming back to this and making it full work. 

## Credits 
I was able to create what I did from working with our instructor at the bootcamp as well as working with other classmates while using online sources.
